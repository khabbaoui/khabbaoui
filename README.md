# 👋 Hi, I'm Khabbaoui Othmane  

I'm a **junior data engineer** from Morocco, currently studying at **ENSIAS** (National School of Computer Science and Systems Analysis).  
I'm passionate about **data engineering**, **cloud technologies**, and **big data architectures** — basically anything that turns raw data into something meaningful and useful.

### 💡 About Me

- 💻 I enjoy building **end-to-end data pipelines**, from ingestion to analytics and visualization.  
- ☁️ I’ve worked with both **private cloud (VMware)** and **public cloud (AWS)** infrastructures.  
- ⚙️ I like working with **Apache tools** — Spark, Kafka, Airflow, Cassandra — to design scalable data systems.  
- 🧠 I’m also interested in **MLOps**, **SIEM systems**, and **real-time data streaming**.  
- 🎯 My goal is to become a **Cloud Data Engineer**, bridging big data and cloud architecture.
